# Propensity-Score

## Project 1   
### Analysis Plan       
1. Objectives: 1) Query the National Cancer Data Base for patients with surgically resected lung cancer; 2) Compare outcomees between patients with early clinical stage lung cancer undergoing lobectomy via a thoracotomy versus a. minimally invasive surgical approcah.   
2. Dataset: National Cancer Data Base (Study Sample: Open N = 38799, VATs N = 21317)    
3. Outcomes:    
   a. Overall Survival  
   b. Mortality within 30 days of the most definitive primary site surgery   
   c. Upstaging  
   d. Surgical. Margin


## Project 2 
### Analysis Plan
1. Objectives : 1)Factors linked to the utilization of the PBT; 2)Whether the PBT can offer prolonged overall survival benefit compared to other standard radiation therapies among patients with brain tumor   
2. Dataset: National cancer database PUF 2016   
3. Statistical Methods:  
Descriptive statistics was categorized by different kinds of treatment. Univariate logistics regression and multivariate logistics regression were applied to assess the selection bias and background difference in the comparison groups. Cox proportional analysis was applied to assess the association between total survival and different kinds of treatment. Propensity score based method was also used in this report. Matching and weighting methods were chose based on the common support of the data.

## Project 3
### Analysis Plan
Predicting Progression Free Survival after surgery for patients with localized renal
cell carcinoma (RCC). 
Emory patients diagnosed 2009-2013 for localized RCC under surgery.
